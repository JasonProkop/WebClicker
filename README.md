The Webclicker project originated as a class project which sought to create an online replacement for the clicker tool which is used in many Universities to grade in-class quizzes.

Webclicker simplifies this process by removing the necessity for the hardware clicker, instead enabling users to take the quizzes on their mobile internet ready devices.
